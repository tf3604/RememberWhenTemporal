-- So naturally there isn't one in the history table either.

-- What heppens if we alter the customer table?
-- Let's make it mandatory.

--ALTER TABLE only allows columns to be added that can contain nulls, or have a DEFAULT definition specified, or the column being added is an identity or timestamp column, or alternatively if none of the previous conditions are satisfied the table must be empty to allow addition of this column. Column 'PostalCode' cannot be added to non-empty table 'CustomerHistory' because it does not satisfy these conditions.

-- Nothing new here, that would have failed on a non-temporal table as well.
-- Let's give it a default.
alter table dbo.Customer

-- Check the results.
select * from dbo.Customer;

-- The default values pass down to the history table as well.

-- Let's add a nullable column
alter table dbo.Customer

-- That worked.  Check the results.

-- Update the email address a couple of times.

alter table dbo.Customer
