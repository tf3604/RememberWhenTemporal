-- Actually, we're OK.  So long as we disable and re-enable system versioning within a transaction,
-- activity against the table will block.  So long as the purge itself is small, the block should
-- be short enough that in most cases we don't need to worry about it.

-- Actually, the only problem is that SQL checks for delete from a history table at compile time.  Since history.CustomerHistory
-- is a valid history table at the time we compile this batch, we get the error.

-- The solution is to either
-- (1) Break up the above into multiple batches.  Kind of a pain because we need to deal with the variable somehow.
-- (2) Use dynamic SQL.  Also a pain.
